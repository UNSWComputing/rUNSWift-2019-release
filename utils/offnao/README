Welcome to Off-Nao, the rUNSWift debugging toolsuite.

To build this project, either:

You get lucky and bin/build_setup.sh just works :D
(verified under Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS both natively and in VMs; 
but builds successfully then segfaults at runtime in libGL.so.1
under fresh download of 14.04.3 LTS @ 15/9/2015 
according to gdb - so much for Ubuntu being stable).

---OR--- 
You need Qt4 and probably a bunch of other things like QGLViewer to build it natively:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./offnao

Once you have performed the steps above once, in future you only need to:

$ make
$ ./offnao

In the 'build' directory
