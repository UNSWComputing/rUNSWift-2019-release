# Please don't add pictures here.

## Adding images to wiki
Go to the wiki. 
Underneath the list of pages on the right, there is a link to *Clone this wiki locally*.
On your computer, do a `git clone`.

There is a folder called images in there.
Add your images. 
Then in the wiki, the link to add is `[[images/file-name]]`

This will help keep the repo clean and lightweight.
