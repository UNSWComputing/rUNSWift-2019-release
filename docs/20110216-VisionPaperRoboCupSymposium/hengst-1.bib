@article{Seed:2009fk,
	Abstract = {The trap-tube problem is difficult for chimpanzees to solve; in several studies only 1 to 2 subjects learn the solution. The authors tested eight chimpanzees on a non-tool-using version of the problem to investigate whether the inclusion of a tool in previous tests of the trap problem may have masked the ability of chimpanzees to solve it. All eight learned to avoid the trap, in 40 to 100 trials. One transferred to two tasks that had no visual cue in common. The authors examined the performance of 15 chimpanzees on a new task in a 2 x 2 design: seven had experience on the two-trap box, eight had not; half of each group was tested with a tool, half without one. An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of tool-inclusion and experience (p < .05). Our results show that including a tool in the trap problem profoundly affects the ability of chimpanzees to solve it. With regard to what the chimpanzees had learned, the results support the notion that rather than using the available stimuli as arbitrary cues, the subjects had encoded information about functional properties.},

@inproceedings{stoberICDL2008,
	Abstract = {{An embodied agent senses the world at the pixel level through a large number of sense elements. In order to function intelligently, an agent needs high-level concepts, grounded in the pixel level. For human designers to program these concepts and their grounding explicitly is almost certainly intractable, so the agent must learn these foundational concepts autonomously. We describe an approach by which an autonomous learning agent can bootstrap its way from pixel-level interaction with the world, to individuating and tracking objects in the environment, to learning an effective policy for its behavior. We use methods drawn from computational scientific discovery to identify derived variables that support simplified models of the dynamics of the environment. These derived variables are abstracted to discrete qualitative variables, which serve as features for temporal difference learning. Our method bridges the gap between the continuous tracking of objects and the discrete state representation necessary for efficient and effective learning. We demonstrate and evaluate this approach with an agent experiencing a simple simulated world, through a sensory interface consisting of 60,000 time-varying binary variables in a 200 x 300 array, plus a three-valued motor signal and a real-valued reward signal.}},

                 environments, but these three ideas have rarely been
                 studied together.  This paper develops a unified
                 framework that formalizes these algorithmic
                 contributions as operators on learned models of the
                 environment.  Our formalism reveals some synergies
                 among these innovations, and it suggests a
                 straightforward way to compose them.  The resulting
                 algorithm, Fitted R-MAXQ, is the first to combine
                 the function approximation of fitted algorithms, the
                 efficient model-based exploration of R-MAX, and the
                 hierarchical decompostion of MAXQ.},

After this, we consider the capabilities that a  cognitive  architecture should support, some properties that it should exhibit related to representation, organization, performance, and learning, and some criteria for evaluating such architectures at the systems level. In closing, we discuss some open issues that should drive future research in this important area.},

@phdthesis{Riley:thesis,
	Abstract = {The ability to construct autonomous robots that are
		 able to learn from the environment in which they
		 operate in order to achieve their objectives is a need
		 so far largely unsatisfied, especially for dynamic
		 environments which change quickly and are noisy and
		 uncertain. A method of developing controllers for
		 simple robots that learn, via artificial evolution, how
		 to react in the noisy, uncertain and dynamic
		 environment of simulated robot soccer in order to
		 achieve goal scoring behaviour is investigated by this
		 thesis. A rule-based architecture that uses a
		 fuzzy-logic inferencing system is proposed for the
		 simulated soccer player. The set of rules that controls
		 the behaviour of the player is developed by evolving a
		 population of simulated soccer-playing robots that are
		 evaluated in the robot soccer environment. The
		 evolutionary algorithm implemented to evolve the rules
		 is a messy coded genetic algorithm. The soccer
		 simulation environment chosen for this work is the
		 RoboCup Soccer Simulation League, which is a dynamic,
		 noisy, real-time environment specifically developed for
		 artificial intelligence research. However, because the
		 RoboCup simulator is a real-time environment all
		 training and testing in the environment takes place in
		 real-time, and this has a significant impact on the
		 capacity of the method to do any real learning. The
		 client-server architecture of the RoboCup simulator
		 further complicates the implementation of the learning
		 process. To overcome these impediments a less complex
		 model of the RoboCup simulator was created. The new
		 simulator, named SimpleSoccer, is a multi-player
		 capable, dynamic environment that is not noisy, does
		 not operate in real-time, and does not implement a
		 client-server architecture. The simplified environment
		 of SimpleSoccer allows the evolutionary process to run
		 much faster than in the RoboCup environment, so real
		 learning can take place in more reasonable time frames.
		 Tests are performed to ensure that the SimpleSoccer
		 environment is a sufficiently good model of the RoboCup
		 environment and that rules learned in the simpler
		 environment are transferable to the RoboCup
		 environment. A method of accelerating the evolutionary
		 search in the RoboCup environment by seeding the
		 population with rules learned in the SimpleSoccer
		 environment is demonstrated. This thesis also examines
		 the question of how human expertise and expert
		 knowledge affects the evolutionary search. Developing
		 good soccer-playing skills for the robot soccer
		 environment is known to be a difficult problem for
		 evolutionary algorithms, and the problem is often
		 solved by giving players some innate, hand-coded skills
		 to increase the probability that the players will
		 achieve the overall objective set. A well designed
		 fitness function for the evolutionary algorithm can
		 artificially guide the evolutionary process by
		 rewarding incremental and intermediate solutions. Tests
		 are conducted to determine how varying the amount of
		 human help given to the evolutionary algorithm affects
		 the result of the evolutionary process. Finally, the
		 thesis investigates the underlying cause of the
		 difficulty of the robot soccer problem for evolutionary
		 algorithms. A systematic study of the problem search
		 spaces and fitness landscapes is presented which
		 provides a good understanding of why the problem is
		 difficult, and how injecting human expertise and expert
		 knowledge in various ways can change the relative
		 difficulty of the problem. The study also leads to the
		 conjecture that there is an inherent limit to the
		 amount of learning possible by evolutionary
		 algorithms.},
