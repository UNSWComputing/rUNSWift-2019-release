@article{Fazl-Ersi25012012,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel context-based scene recognition method that enables mobile robots to recognize previously observed topological places in known environments or categorize previously unseen places in new environments. We achieve this by introducing the Histogram of Oriented Uniform Patterns (HOUP), which provides strong discriminative power for place recognition, while offering a significant level of generalization for place categorization. HOUP descriptors are used for image representation within a subdivision framework, where the size and location of sub-regions are
determined using an informative feature selection method based on kernel alignment. Further improvement is achieved by developing a similarity measure that accounts for perceptual aliasing to eliminate the effect of indistinctive but visually similar regions that are frequently present in outdoor and indoor scenes. An extensive set of experiments reveals the excellent performance of our method on challenging categorization and recognition tasks. Specifically, our proposed method outperforms the current state of the art on two place categorization datasets with 15 and 5 place categories, and two topological place recognition datasets, with 5 and 27 places.},

	Abstract = {We study the problem of designing dynamically feasible trajectories and controllers that drive a quadrotor to a desired state in state space. We focus on the development of a family of trajectories defined as a sequence of segments, each with a controller parameterized by a goal state or region in state space. Each controller is developed from the dynamic model the robot and then iteratively refined through successive experimental trials in an automated fashion to account for errors in the dynamic model and noise in the actuators and sensors. We show that this approach permits the development of trajectories and controllers enabling such aggressive maneuvers as flying through narrow, vertical gaps and perching on inverted surfaces with high precision and repeatability.},

	Abstract = {We describe CST, an online algorithm for constructing skill trees from demonstration trajectories. CST segments a demonstration trajectory into a chain of component skills, where each skill has a goal and is assigned a suitable abstraction from an abstraction library. These properties permit skills to be improved efficiently using a policy learning algorithm. Chains from multiple demonstration trajectories are merged into a skill tree. We show that CST can be used to acquire skills from human demonstration in a dynamic continuous domain, and from both expert demonstration and learned control sequences on the uBot-5 mobile manipulator.},

@inproceedings{AAAI07-Symposium-Taylor,
	Abstract = {Transfer learning problems are typically framed as
        leveraging knowledge learned on a source task to improve
        learning on a related, but different, target task. Current
        transfer learning methods are able to successfully transfer
        knowledge from a source reinforcement learning task into a
        target task, reducing learning time. However, the
        complimentary task of transferring knowledge between agents
        with different internal representations has not been well
        explored The goal in both types of transfer problems is the
        same: reduce the time needed to learn the target with
        transfer, relative to learning the target without
        transfer. This work defines representation transfer, contrasts
        it with task transfer, and introduces two novel
        algorithms. Additionally, we show representation transfer
        algorithms can also be successfully used for task transfer,
        providing an empirical connection between the two
        problems. These algorithms are fully implemented in a complex
        multiagent domain and experiments demonstrate that
        transferring the learned knowledge between different
        representations is both possible and beneficial.  },

In this paper, we present a closed-loop gait, as it was used at the RoboCup competition 2010. We will explain how the inverted pendulum model is used to create trajectories for the center of mass of an omnidirectional gait and how it allows to eliminate the need of the so-called double-support phase by dynamically adjusting the point in time at which the support foot alternates. Furthermore, we will briefly describe our approach for integrating sensor feedback to this model and how to transform the target trajectory of the center of mass into positions for the foot placement.},

	Abstract = {The reinforcement learning paradigm is a popular way
        to address problems that have only limited environmental
        feedback, rather than correctly labeled examples, as is common
        in other machine learning contexts. While significant progress
        has been made to improve learning in a single task, the idea
        of transfer learning has only recently been applied to
        reinforcement learning tasks. The core idea of transfer is
        that experience gained in learning to perform one task can
        help improve learning performance in a related, but different,
        task. In this article we present a framework that classifies
        transfer learning methods in terms of their capabilities and
        goals, and then use it to survey the existing literature, as
        well as to suggest future directions for transfer learning
        work.},

	Abstract = {Decision theory formally solves the problem of rational agents in
                  uncertain worlds if the true environmental prior probability
                  distribution is known. Solomonoff's theory of universal induction
                  formally solves the problem of sequence prediction for unknown
                  prior distribution. We combine both ideas and get a parameter-free
                  theory of universal Artificial Intelligence. We give strong
                  arguments that the resulting AIXI model is the most intelligent
                  unbiased agent possible. We outline for a number of problem
                  classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function
                  minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning, how the AIXI
                  model can formally solve them. The major drawback of the AIXI
                  model is that it is uncomputable. To overcome this problem, we
                  construct a modified algorithm AIXI$tl$ that is still
                  effectively more intelligent than any other time $t$ and length $l$
                  bounded agent. The computation time of AIXI$tl$ is of the order $t
                  \cdot 2^l$. Other discussed topics are formal definitions of
                  intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations of
                  the AIXI theory to other AI approaches.},

It is based on hierarchical finite state machines. By the new extensions the development of cooperative multi agent behavior is supported through language elements which allow to conveniently specify how the state machines of multiple agents interact. Basic properties of XABSL are illustrated in direct comparison with Petri Net Plans and the COLBERT language using examples of basic robot behavior. More complex examples from robot soccer are used to illustrate the new extensions of XABSL. The complete system is available online on the XABSL website (http://www.xabsl.de).},

	Abstract = {{Presenting a reference model architecture for the design of intelligent systems Engineering of Mind presents the foundations for a computational theory of intelligence. It discusses the main streams of investigation that will eventually converge in a scientific theory of mind and proposes an avenue of research that might best lead to the development of truly intelligent systems. This book presents a model of the brain as a hierarchy of massive parallel computational modules and data structures interconnected by information pathways. Using this as the basic model on which intelligent systems should be based, the authors propose a reference model architecture that accommodates concepts from artificial intelligence, control theory, image understanding, signal processing, and decision theory. Algorithms, procedures, and data embedded within this architecture would enable the analysis of situations, the formulation of plans, the choice of behaviors, and the computation of uncertainties. The computational power to implement the model can be achieved in practical systems in the foreseeable future through hierarchical and parallel distribution of computational tasks. The authors' reference model architecture is expressed in terms of the Real-time Control System (RCS) that has been developed primarily at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Suitable for engineers, computer scientists, researchers, and students, Engineering of Mind blends current theory and practice to achieve a coherent model for the design of intelligent systems.}},

	Abstract = {The trap-tube problem is difficult for chimpanzees to solve; in several studies only 1 to 2 subjects learn the solution. The authors tested eight chimpanzees on a non-tool-using version of the problem to investigate whether the inclusion of a tool in previous tests of the trap problem may have masked the ability of chimpanzees to solve it. All eight learned to avoid the trap, in 40 to 100 trials. One transferred to two tasks that had no visual cue in common. The authors examined the performance of 15 chimpanzees on a new task in a 2 x 2 design: seven had experience on the two-trap box, eight had not; half of each group was tested with a tool, half without one. An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of tool-inclusion and experience (p < .05). Our results show that including a tool in the trap problem profoundly affects the ability of chimpanzees to solve it. With regard to what the chimpanzees had learned, the results support the notion that rather than using the available stimuli as arbitrary cues, the subjects had encoded information about functional properties.},

	Abstract = {{An embodied agent senses the world at the pixel level through a large number of sense elements. In order to function intelligently, an agent needs high-level concepts, grounded in the pixel level. For human designers to program these concepts and their grounding explicitly is almost certainly intractable, so the agent must learn these foundational concepts autonomously. We describe an approach by which an autonomous learning agent can bootstrap its way from pixel-level interaction with the world, to individuating and tracking objects in the environment, to learning an effective policy for its behavior. We use methods drawn from computational scientific discovery to identify derived variables that support simplified models of the dynamics of the environment. These derived variables are abstracted to discrete qualitative variables, which serve as features for temporal difference learning. Our method bridges the gap between the continuous tracking of objects and the discrete state representation necessary for efficient and effective learning. We demonstrate and evaluate this approach with an agent experiencing a simple simulated world, through a sensory interface consisting of 60,000 time-varying binary variables in a 200 x 300 array, plus a three-valued motor signal and a real-valued reward signal.}},

	Abstract = {Innovations such as optimistic exploration, function
                 approximation, and hierarchical decomposition have
                 helped scale reinforcement learning to more complex
                 environments, but these three ideas have rarely been
                 studied together.  This paper develops a unified
                 framework that formalizes these algorithmic
                 contributions as operators on learned models of the
                 environment.  Our formalism reveals some synergies
                 among these innovations, and it suggests a
                 straightforward way to compose them.  The resulting
                 algorithm, Fitted R-MAXQ, is the first to combine
                 the function approximation of fitted algorithms, the
                 efficient model-based exploration of R-MAX, and the
                 hierarchical decompostion of MAXQ.},

In closing, we discuss some open issues that should drive future research in this important area.},

@phdthesis{Riley:thesis,
	Abstract = {The ability to construct autonomous robots that are
		 able to learn from the environment in which they
		 operate in order to achieve their objectives is a need
		 so far largely unsatisfied, especially for dynamic
		 environments which change quickly and are noisy and
		 uncertain. A method of developing controllers for
		 simple robots that learn, via artificial evolution, how
		 to react in the noisy, uncertain and dynamic
		 environment of simulated robot soccer in order to
		 achieve goal scoring behaviour is investigated by this
		 thesis. A rule-based architecture that uses a
		 fuzzy-logic inferencing system is proposed for the
		 simulated soccer player. The set of rules that controls
		 the behaviour of the player is developed by evolving a
		 population of simulated soccer-playing robots that are
		 evaluated in the robot soccer environment. The
		 evolutionary algorithm implemented to evolve the rules
		 is a messy coded genetic algorithm. The soccer
		 simulation environment chosen for this work is the
		 RoboCup Soccer Simulation League, which is a dynamic,
		 noisy, real-time environment specifically developed for
		 artificial intelligence research. However, because the
		 RoboCup simulator is a real-time environment all
		 training and testing in the environment takes place in
		 real-time, and this has a significant impact on the
		 capacity of the method to do any real learning. The
		 client-server architecture of the RoboCup simulator
		 further complicates the implementation of the learning
		 process. To overcome these impediments a less complex
		 model of the RoboCup simulator was created. The new
		 simulator, named SimpleSoccer, is a multi-player
		 capable, dynamic environment that is not noisy, does
		 not operate in real-time, and does not implement a
		 client-server architecture. The simplified environment
		 of SimpleSoccer allows the evolutionary process to run
		 much faster than in the RoboCup environment, so real
		 learning can take place in more reasonable time frames.
		 Tests are performed to ensure that the SimpleSoccer
		 environment is a sufficiently good model of the RoboCup
		 environment and that rules learned in the simpler
		 environment are transferable to the RoboCup
		 environment. A method of accelerating the evolutionary
		 search in the RoboCup environment by seeding the
		 population with rules learned in the SimpleSoccer
		 environment is demonstrated. This thesis also examines
		 the question of how human expertise and expert
		 knowledge affects the evolutionary search. Developing
		 good soccer-playing skills for the robot soccer
		 environment is known to be a difficult problem for
		 evolutionary algorithms, and the problem is often
		 solved by giving players some innate, hand-coded skills
		 to increase the probability that the players will
		 achieve the overall objective set. A well designed
		 fitness function for the evolutionary algorithm can
		 artificially guide the evolutionary process by
		 rewarding incremental and intermediate solutions. Tests
		 are conducted to determine how varying the amount of
		 human help given to the evolutionary algorithm affects
		 the result of the evolutionary process. Finally, the
		 thesis investigates the underlying cause of the
		 difficulty of the robot soccer problem for evolutionary
		 algorithms. A systematic study of the problem search
		 spaces and fitness landscapes is presented which
		 provides a good understanding of why the problem is
		 difficult, and how injecting human expertise and expert
		 knowledge in various ways can change the relative
		 difficulty of the problem. The study also leads to the
		 conjecture that there is an inherent limit to the
		 amount of learning possible by evolutionary
		 algorithms.},
