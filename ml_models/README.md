1. To train a model, use command like "python ml_training.py --train classifier_data --dump ball_classifier" where classifier_data is the directory you store the training data (start with "t" for positive data and "f" for negative data) and ball_classifer is the name of model files.
2. Copy the model files to /home/nao/data if you want to use Vatnao-legacy.
